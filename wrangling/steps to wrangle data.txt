Step 1
In your terminal/command line, install the PDFTables Python library with:
-->
pip install git+https://github.com/pdftables/python-pdftables-api.git

If git is not recognised, download it here. Then, run the above command again.
Or if you'd prefer to install it manually, you can download it from python-pdftables-api then install it with:
-->
python setup.py install

Step 2
Create a new Python script then add the following code:
--> 
import pdftables_api
c = pdftables_api.Client('my-api-key')
c.xlsx('input.pdf', 'output') #replace c.xlsx with c.csv to convert to CSV

Now, you'll need to make the following changes to the script:
Replace my-api-key with your PDFTables API key, which you can get here.
Replace input.pdf with the PDF you would like to convert.
Replace output with the name you'd like to give the converted document.
Now, save your finished script as convert-pdf.py in the same directory as the PDF document you want to convert.

Step 3
Open your command line/terminal and change your directory (e.g. cd C:/Users/Bob) to the folder you saved your convert-pdf.py script and PDF in, then run the following command:
-->  
python convert-pdf.py

To find your converted spreadsheet, navigate to the folder in your file explorer and hey presto, you've converted a PDF to Excel or CSV with Python!
